# OneNote C# SDK

A simple REST client for Microsoft OneNote. It's fully functional and is used in a few production ready tools.

Unfortunately I don't have time to create full blown documentation and set up a CI pipeline for this project, but feel free to ask any questions by raising an issue here.
